Arianne XP
----------
Arianne is a multiplayer online games framework and engine to develop turn based
and real time games. It provides a simple way of creating games on a portable 
and robust server architecture. The server is coded in Java and uses Python for 
your game description, provides a MySQL backend and uses an UDP transport channel
to communicate with dozens of players.

Arianne XP is a complete implementation of the network protocol described in
Marauroa, in standard ISO C++, and fully tested with test cases. 
It is using SDL, SDL_net, cppUnit, Python and SWIG.

The point is to be able to connect to an Marauroa server using this framework, 
and allow creating games using Python as the development language.


Requirements
------------
Before you even try to compile ariannexp please go and download
- SDL 1.2.x
- SDL_net 1.2.x

You will also need if you want to get working pyarianne
- SWIG 1.13.21
- Python 2.3

Instructions for Linux
----------------------
To build Arianne ( please don't install it ) use the next commands one after 
the other:

  aclocal
  autoheader
  libtoolize 
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make

Then if everything went as it should be, you will have two things mainly:
  
  ./AIGladiator/AIGladiator
  This is a test client for connecting to gladiators and fight ( for you ).
  It does nothing, and it is not interactive.

  ./libFramework/pyarianne
  This directory contains the module needed to develop your own pythons clients
  See test.py and execute it by doing 

  python test.py

  If you want to develop your own client you should read:

  - http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/pyArianneAPIDefinition
  - http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/pyArianneAPIExample
  

Instructions for Windows
------------------------
Congratulations brave friend!.

Just install SDL, SDL_net and cppUnit so that it is reachable by Visual Studio.
I actually created a folder called Development and placed two folders inside:
- include
- lib

Then just copy everything that is in include folder to our Development/include, 
apply the same procedure for lib.

Now simple configure Visual Studio to find that folders at Include paths and 
Library paths.

You shouldn't modify the original project files to do this.

Now, simply Generate the solution.


What it does
------------
The test case connect to a Marauroa server and proceed with a normal login, 
choose character and logout operation.
There is no game here... just go the games at:

http://arianne.sourceforge.net


Things that need to be done and I can't do by myself
----------------------------------------------------
- Add proper installation routines
- Add check in configure.in for SWIG and Python		(done by Bubelgum)
- Remove static path at libFramework/Makefile.am	(done by Bubelgum)
- Make clean to work correctly				(done by Bubelgum)
- Make dist and distclean to work correctly		(distclean done by Bubelgum)
